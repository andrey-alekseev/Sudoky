# Sudoky
Sudoku solver coded with python. Pretty simple.

If for some odd reason you happened to pop here knowing absolutely nothing about how that backtrack thingy works, i'll explain it briefly. Google [backtracking sudoku](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3Z7zEc7AXQ) for more.
For starters, backtracking isn't too far of what the name suggests. The program "takes decisions in chain" to advance with solving the problem. If at some point the problem can't be solved, it goes back in the chain and take another decision, and it keep doing it over and over again until we either solve everything or run out of possibilities.
Of course, to take those "decisions in chain" there should have some sort logic on it.
Will you give my project a star? Pretty please :')
Don't forget to search about backtracking! It will be good to learn about it.
