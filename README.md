That means nothing. As far as i know...

This is a program that solves sudokus. Coded in python. Pretty simple.
If for some odd reason you happened to pop here before and you are curious about how this thing works. Google "backtracking sudoku".
For starters, backtracking isn't too far of what the name suggests. The program "takes decisions in chain" to advance with solving the problem. If at some point in the future the problem can't be solved, it goes back and take another decision, and it keep doing it over and over again until we solve the problem.
Of course to take those "decisions in chain" there should have some sort logic on it. Otherwise it'd be less painful to just randomize the process.
